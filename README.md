# RelateContactsWebresource
In this project, we tried to create an HTML Webresource in Dynamics CRM Account Form, which will enable users to simply search for Contacts by their
names, drag and drop them to the specified tab and relate these contacts to the Account record simply by pressing a button. 
This logic behind is implemented by the use of Typescript rather than raw JS.
